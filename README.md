### Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Manim Madhav and I'm studying Computer Science with Specialization in Data Science from VIT, Vellore.<br/>
<br/>
This is cool, turns out there's a Python library used to create mathematical animations called 'Manim', and I'm pretty sure it's named after me.:laughing:<br/>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python, Basic WebDev and ML.
