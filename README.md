### Hey there, Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Manim Madhav and I'm studying Computer Science with Specialization in Data Science from VIT, Vellore.<br/>
<br/>
This is cool, turns out there's a Python library used to create mathematical animations called <a href='https://github.com/3b1b/manim'>Manim</a>, and I'm pretty sure it's named after me.:laughing:<br/>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python, C++, Basic WebDev and ML.
